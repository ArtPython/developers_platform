                These days it is very common to see the job title “Fullstack Developer” on LinkedIn.
                Job adverts, developers or even wannabe developers are using this term quite a lot.
                Recruiters are looking for that jack of all trades while programmers are bragging about mastering
                the whole palette of technologies that usually goes into an application.

                You’ve probably guessed that I don’t like this title.
                I believe that such a person will be at best mediocre in what they do.
                I am surely not the only one who thinks this way, but let me just explain my reasoning.
