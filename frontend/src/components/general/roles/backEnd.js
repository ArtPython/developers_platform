            <h1>Who is backend developer?</h1>
            <p>As you would probably already be aware, 
                in a typical client-server architecture, 
                application data is stored in the server-side 
                and served as output to the client-side. The server-side 
                working of a web application is known as backend. 
                That’s where all the inner working of web applications 
                takes place, and that’s where the work of backend developers lies.

                Backend developers are responsible 
                for using programming languages to create the code, 
                which actually makes web applications function the way they’re supposed to. 
                The code that these developers write runs on the webserver. I
                n addition to writing back-end code, 
                such developers are also responsible 
                for developing APIs used by the mobile version of such web applications.</p>
