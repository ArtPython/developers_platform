                Front-end development or the client-side is the graphical/visual 
                development side of an application or a website that a user can interact with.

                For example, one of the top companies and widely famous amongst us all – Netflix.

                Netflix’s front-end development is neat, precise, and aesthetic. 
                In addition to this, their front-end developers focus on the user interface, 
                user experience, and other aspects which are shown to the user.

                Web development includes two sides: the front-end 
                (client-side) and the back-end(server-side). 
                Front-end development allows an interactive experience 
                for the user while back-end development is the coding behind all the components working and existing.
